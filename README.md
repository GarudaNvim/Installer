## Installation

### Steps to Install GarudaNvim

To install GarudaNvim on your macOS system, simply follow these steps:

1. Run the following command in your terminal for the latest release of Installer:
   ```sh
   LATEST=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/GarudaNvim/Installer/releases/latest | grep '"tag_name"' | cut -d '"' -f 4)
   wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GarudaNvim/Installer/$LATEST/installGarudaNvim.sh
   chmod +x installGarudaNvim.sh && { ./installGarudaNvim.sh } || { echo }
   rm -f installGarudaNvim.sh
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts:
   - If an existing Neovim configuration is found, you'll be given two options:
     - **Delete** your current Neovim configuration and proceed with the GarudaNvim installation.
     - **Backup(Automatic/Manual)** your current configuration and install GarudaNvim.
   
   - If you choose to **delete** your current configuration, the installer will remove your Neovim configuration along with related directories in `~/.local/share`, `~/.local/state`, and `~/.cache`.

   - If you choose to **automatically backup** your configuration, the installer will create backups of your current setup (e.g., `~/.config/nvim.bak`, `~/.local/share/nvim.bak`, etc.), and then proceed with the installation of GarudaNvim.

   - If you choose to **manually backup** your configuration, then go ahead and move(or rename) your current config. After that, run this script again.

4. Once the installation is complete, youâ€™ll see a success message, and you can start using GarudaNvim by opening Neovim.

## Features

The **GarudaNvim Installer** and **Uninstaller** come with several convenient features to ensure an easy and smooth user experience:

1. **Automatic OS Detection**: 
   - The script detects which OS is present on the user's machine, whether it is Unix based or not.
   - If the OS is not supported then the script aborts the installation and exits.

2. **Automatic Configuration Detection**:
   - The installer script automatically checks whether a Neovim configuration already exists in the system (i.e., in `~/.config/nvim`).
   - If a configuration is found, the installer will prompt the user with two options:
     - **Backup**: Automatically backs up the existing configuration so it can be restored later if needed.
     - **Delete**: Deletes the existing configuration to install GarudaNvim from scratch.
   
3. **Safe Backup Option**:
   - The installer provides the option to back up the existing configuration before installing GarudaNvim.
   - The backup includes not only `~/.config/nvim` but also other related directories like `~/.local/share/nvim`, `~/.local/state/nvim`, and `~/.cache/nvim`.

4. **Complete Uninstallation**:
   - The uninstallation script checks for the presence of GarudaNvim (`~/.config/nvim/lua/garudanvim`) and confirms with the user before proceeding.
   - If confirmed, the script removes all related GarudaNvim configurations and associated directories (`~/.config/nvim`, `~/.local/share/nvim`, `~/.local/state/nvim`, `~/.cache/nvim`) to ensure a clean uninstall.

These features make it easy to manage Neovim setups, providing flexibility for users who may want to switch between different configurations without losing their previous setup.

## Uninstallation

### Steps to Uninstall GarudaNvim

If you wish to uninstall GarudaNvim and remove all related configuration, follow these steps:

1. Run this uninstaller script in your terminal using the following command:
   ```sh
   X=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/GarudaNvim/Installer/releases/latest | grep '"tag_name"' | cut -d '"' -f 4)
   wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GarudaNvim/Installer/$X/uninstallGarudaNvim.sh
   chmod +x uninstallGarudaNvim.sh && ./uninstallGarudaNvim.sh && rm uninstallGarudaNvim.sh
   ```

2. The script will first check if GarudaNvim is installed by looking for the `garudanvim` directory inside your Neovim configuration (`~/.config/nvim/lua/garudanvim`).
   
   - If found, you will be prompted to confirm the uninstallation process.
   
   - If GarudaNvim is not found, the uninstaller will exit, as there is no GarudaNvim configuration to remove.

3. If you confirm the uninstallation, the following directories will be permanently deleted:
   - `~/.config/nvim`
   - `~/.local/share/nvim`
   - `~/.local/state/nvim`
   - `~/.cache/nvim`

4. Once the uninstallation is complete, you will see a success message.
